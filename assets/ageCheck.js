//Things to do -
// Make it so that if the user is under 21 they get redirected to a kid friendly page
//Check to see if the age is legal, if so then let the user access the page
//All that will run once the user hits the verify button
//Set it to redirect the user if they try to skip the age verification process
//Only allow the user to view the page once its confiremed they are 21
